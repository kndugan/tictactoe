# React Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description

In this project, I've used React to create a Tic Tac Toe game. Each Player will have alternate turns to place an X or O on the board. The first player to get 3 X's or O's in a row is the winner.

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.

## How to Run

To run this program, simply open the index.html file in your browser, you can then begin the game. Once the game is over, the result of the game will display.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Future improvements will include adding a restart button instead of refreshing the browser and timer for each player during their turn.
